Project Vision:

This software will benefit the user because it will allow for easy management of an online store’s inventory, allowing the store to add/remove items, keep track of the total inventory, keep track of orders. The system will manage the store’s inventory allowing the employees to focus on other tasks. The main stakeholders for this project are the customers of the store and the store’s employees. The customers will only be able to purchase the items if they are in stock, and the employees will need to know if stock is getting low so that they can order more. The system will have a GUI that allows for the user to look up an item by an ID number and see its stock, a general description, and make a purchase. The software will also need to keep track of the items that the customer has added to their cart, to enable the purchase of multiple items.
